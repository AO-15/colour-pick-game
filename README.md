# colour-pick-game
Colour pick game that tests the Stroop effect.

This game is inspired by Lenstore. 
Lenstore has a game that shows you the name of a color and asks you to pick the color you see. You need to find the matching color from a bunch of other colors. It's a fun game of finding the right color!

The company tested the game out on 2,000 adults and says 79% of respondents got 5/5 for matching colors, while just 21% got 10/10 for the mismatching colors.
